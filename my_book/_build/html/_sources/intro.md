Introduction
============================

The terms inference and prediction are frequently used in the context of statistics. Understanding the difference between them can be difficult even for people working long in the field. They are often confused because they are not mutually exclusive. Both of them are related to gain information from the data. They appear similar but the difference should be well-drawn out. In this post, I will try to distinguish them based on their definitions, problem statements and applications. In the meantime, I will explain the difference by considering examples from both inference and prediction perspectives.
